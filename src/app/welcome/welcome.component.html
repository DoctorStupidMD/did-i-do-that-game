					<li>Before the game starts, all players will have provided three weird or quirky facts about themselves.</li>
					<li>Your goal is to select the connect the correct player to each "Did I do that?" prompt. Ask questions, accuse each other, throw someone under the bus.</li>
					<li>If the prompt belongs to you, fiercely defend and deny it - even if it's your own prompt! Throw them off your trail!</li>
					<li>Everyone will have 60 seconds per prompt to accuse, oppose, challenge, defend, rebuke, and just flat-out argue their guesses before locking in their selection.</li>
					<li>The player(s) who has matched the most prompts wins!</li>
